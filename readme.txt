Direct Mail is a very effective method of keeping in contact with your customers and building brand loyalty. 87% of consumers rate messages delivered by post as believable, compared to 48% for Email.**

This plugin makes it easy to post Direct Mail campaigns to your WooCommerce customers, and even segments them for you into useful groups. 

Do you want to send your most valuable customers a letter with a VIP thank you code? How about a a special offer postcard to reactivate customers who haven’t purchased for 6 months? Abandoned cart? Why not send them a postcard with an offer and a photo of the products in their basket? 

All of this (and much more) is just a few clicks away.

== How does it work? ==

When you download the Direct Mail for WooCommerce the wizard will help you [register for a Stannp.com account](https://dash.stannp.com/register?source=woocommerce) or log into your existing account. The plugin connects with the Stannp.com APIs to make it quick and easy to post Direct Mail campaigns to your WooCommerce customers. 

The plugin is free to download, and there are no ongoing charges or subscription fees. You only pay for what you send, and don’t forget if you are a new user we are giving you £50 free credit* to try out our system for yourself!

At Stannp.com we access discounts because of the volume of post we send, and we pass on these savings to our customers, enabling you to send your post for less than the cost of a second-class stamp! You can see the full details of our prices on the [pricing page](https://www.stannp.com/direct-mail/pricing/?source=woocommerce) of our website.

Please note: The campaign will be sent to the recipients of the Stannp Group selected in the Stannp Configuration.
